Python
Underlying Hardware Interface
Module initialization
def __init__(self)
Send a command
def write_cmd(self, cmd)
Send data
def write_data(self, buf)
Adjust backlight
def set_bl_pwm(self,duty)
Drawing GUI
Import a library
import framebuf
Create an object
The custom class LCD_1inch28 inherits the framebuf.FrameBuffer class from MicroPython, which provides many methods to draw images, let's create the LCD_1inch28 class object first

LCD = LCD_1inch28()
Draw a line
LCD.line(x1, y1, x2, y2, color)
Parameters:
	x1, y1: The x and y coordinates of the starting point
	x2, y2: The x and y coordinates of the endpoint
	color:  The color of the line
Draw a rectangle
LCD.fill_rect(x1, y1, w, h, color)
Parameters:
	x1, y1: The x and y coordinates of the upper left corner of the rectangle
        w, h:   The width and height of the rectangle
        color:  The filling color of the rectangle
Draw text
LCD.text(str, x, y, color)
Parameters:
         str:   Display text
	 x, y:  The x and y coordinates of the upper left corner of the text
         color: The color of the text
Change the text size
LCD.write_text(str, x, y, size, color)
Parameters:
	 size: The difference between this function and LCD.text is that it supports custom font size, which is used to specify the font size
Display
LCD.show()
QMI8658
Create an object
qmi8658=QMI8658()
Read and parse the XYZ data of the sensor
xyz=qmi8658.Read_XYZ()
Return values:
          xyz[0]~xyz[2]: The function returns an array, with the first three elements representing acceleration on the X, Y, and Z axes
	  xyz[3]~xyz[5]: These three elements represent the angular velocities on the X, Y, and Z axes
